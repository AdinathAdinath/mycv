          <h3>Video Gaming</h3>
          <p>I like Video Gaming, it is really fun when you can explore new worlds or A new world and try new tactics to win or finish the game. Whether they are PC games or Console games or even Virtual Reality games, the same skill applies everywhere!</p>

          <h3>Chess</h3>
          <p>I wouldn't really consider this as a skill, kinda. Although this can be one thing that I am really good at or comfortable with.</p>
